 * @brief The following #define tells DCS-BIOS that this is a RS-485 slave device.
 * It also sets the address of this slave device. The slave address should be
 * between 1 and 126 and must be unique among all devices on the same bus.
 *
 * @bug Currently does not work with the Pro Micro (32U4), Fails to compile.

//  this is the code of a simple master  (needs simple slave)
//  it send one of 3 (single char) commands to the slave
//  '0' == set LED LOW
//  '1' == set LED HIGH
//  '2' == request status.
//
//  print debug messages SEND and RECV with data.
//  Note that one needs a 2nd Serial port for nice debugging.
//  (or an LCD screen whatever).
